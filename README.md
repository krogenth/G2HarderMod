For all balancing work, it is recommended to get the [G2DataGUI](https://github.com/krogenth/G2DataGUI) mod tool, this will enable you to modify moves, manaeggs, skills, skillbooks, character specials, enemy stats, and more.
Once `G2DataGUI` is downloaded, copy the `G2DataGUI.exe` and accompanying `*.dll` files to the `./mod` directory and run `G2DataGUI.exe`.
For any other work, you will want a hex editor.
